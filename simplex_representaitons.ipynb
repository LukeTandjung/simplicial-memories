    "# Memory has Many Faces: Simplicial Complexes as Agent Memory Layers\n",

    "## Abstract\n",
    "Current memory architectures for large language model agents employ vector embeddings and graph-based representations, yet these approaches show divergent performance characteristics. While retrieval-augmented generation achieves strong results on benchmarks like 86% accuracy on LongMemEval[^1], graph-based methods significantly underperform at 71%[^1], suggesting that existing graph representations fail to capture essential memory structures. This paper proposes simplicial complexes as a unifying representation for agent memory that preserves higher-order relationships without the information loss inherent in pairwise graph projections. We introduce a database-backed simplex tree architecture that enables efficient storage and retrieval of multi-way interactions while supporting standard memory operations. Through a category-theoretic lens, we demonstrate that simplicial complexes occupy a privileged position in the hierarchy of knowledge representations, with structure-preserving functors to both graphs and vector spaces. Our approach enables the representation of contextual co-occurrence patterns—such as entities appearing together in conversations, sessions, or projects—as geometric objects whose dimensional structure naturally encodes confidence and relationship strength.\n",
