    "# Memory has Many Faces: Simplicial Complexes as Agent Memory Layers\n",
    "Luke Tandjung\n",

    "## Abstract\n",
    "Current memory architectures for large language model agents employ vector embeddings and graph-based representations, with both approaches exhibiting significant performance gaps. While retrieval-augmented generation achieves strong results on benchmarks like 86% accuracy on LongMemEval, graph-based methods significantly underperform at 71%. This suggests that existing graph representations fail to capture essential memory structures. This paper proposes simplicial complexes as a unifying representation for agent memory that preserves higher-order relationships without the information loss inherent in pairwise graph projections. We introduce a database-backed simplex tree architecture that enables efficient storage and retrieval of multi-way interactions while supporting standard memory operations. Through a category-theoretic lens, we demonstrate that simplicial complexes occupy a privileged position in the hierarchy of knowledge representations, with structure-preserving functors to both graphs and vector spaces. Our approach enables the representation of contextual co-occurrence patterns (entities appearing together in conversations, or sessions) as geometric objects whose dimensional structure naturally encodes confidence and relationship strength.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Agent memory systems have converged on two paradigms: retrieving memories as vectors embeddings in semantic space, and knowledge graphs representing entity relationships explicitly. Despite recent advances, including hybrid architectures, performance gaps persist. On LongMemEval, RAG systems achieve 86% accuracy while graph-based methods reach only 71%[^1].\n",
    "\n",
    "This gap reflects a representational limitation. Vector embeddings collapse co-occurrence structure into continuous distances, losing discrete relationships. Knowledge graphs preserve structure but are constrained to pairwise interactions. When three or more entities co-occur meaningfully, such as multiple concepts in a conversation, or events in a session, pairwise graphs either discard this information[^2] or attempt reconstruction through secondary inference[^3]. Recent attempts at formalising this information loss include Wang and Kleinberg (2024), which proved the combinatorial impossibility of recovering higher-order structures from graph projections[^4].\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose simplicial complexes as a unifying representation that addresses these limitations. Simplicial complexes occupy a privileged position in the knowledge representation hierarchy, with structure-preserving functors to graphs and vectors while avoiding information loss from projection. The simplex tree data structure provides efficient database-backed implementation. This enables memory architectures preserving contextual co-occurrence patterns, yielding measurable improvements on multi-hop reasoning and temporal queries.\n",
